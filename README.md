# :fire: OBJECT ORIENTED C++ :fire:

### object oriented C++ projects  done during the course 

` IMPORTANT NOTE: the projects in this repo were done in my second semester of intro to computer science class. I had only ~4 months of real programming experience
`
###### Course Description:

Object-oriented algorithmic problem solving in C++, with attention to general as well as language-specific issues including pointer and pointer arithmetic; linked lists; memory management; recursion; operator overloading; inheritance and polymorphism; stream and file I/O; exception handling; templates and STL; applications of simple data structures; testing and debugging techniques.

### ASSIGNMENT # 1 - PERFECT SQUARE PROBLEM
Write a program to find and print the first perfect square (i*i) whose last two digits are both odd.

###### Very important:
Make sure to check that the answer you get is indeed a perfect square.

### ASSIGNMENT # 2 - EQUIVALENT ARRAYS
a[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
b[] = {3,4,5,1,2}

It is possible to transform array a into array b by right shifting each element of a to the “right”
three places. If an element “falls off” the back of the array have it come around the front and
keep counting positions. That is how 3 in array ended up in the first position of array b. One
way to look at this is to imagine that we are moving the element around in a circular manner.
In the example above, we have right shifted the array 3 positions to the right.
Definition: Let a and b be two integer arrays of the same length. We say that they are “shift
equivalent” if array a can be right shifted to create array b.

**PROBLEM:**

Write a function
bool equivalent(int a[], int b[], int n)
which takes two arrays a and b of length n and returns true is they are shift equivalent and false
otherwise.

### ASSIGNMENT # Practice  - Integration
  Inside a loop we sum up the area of rectangles with a small base (say .0001) and
  height f(x) for each x between a and b in increments of .0001. a = 1 b=5. Find 
  the integral when f(x) = x, f(x) = x^2 and f(x) = x^3 between 1 and 5. 
  
  When the loop terminates, we return the value of the sum.
